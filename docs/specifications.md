Envelope Budgeting App (YNAB Clone) - Detailed Specification
1. Core Philosophy Integration:

Give Every Dollar a Job: The UI must constantly display the "To Be Budgeted" (TBB) amount prominently. All interactions involving assigning money must decrease TBB. The goal is visually reinforced when TBB reaches $0.00 (e.g., turns green, displays a confirmation). Budgeting future months is only possible with current positive TBB or available category funds.

Embrace Your True Expenses: Goal setting, particularly "Needed For Spending," is central. The UI should clearly show monthly funding required for these goals and allow quick budgeting actions to meet them.

Roll With The Punches: The "Move Money" feature must be easily accessible and visually intuitive directly from the budget screen. Overspending indicators (red) should immediately prompt action, linking directly to the "Move Money" or "Cover Overspending" workflow. The tone remains neutral/helpful.

Age Your Money: A dedicated metric, clearly visible (perhaps in the header or a reporting dashboard), calculated and updated regularly. Tooltips or info icons explain its meaning and significance.

2. Detailed Feature List:

2.1. User Authentication & Settings:

Requirement: Secure user registration (Email/Password, potentially OAuth via Google/Apple). Secure login with password reset functionality.

Requirement: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA) option (e.g., TOTP authenticator app).

Requirement: User Profile Management (Name, Email, Password Change).

Requirement: Subscription Management (View plan, billing history, cancel/change subscription - integrates with payment provider).

Requirement: Budget Management (Create new budget, open existing budget, budget settings like currency format, date format, first month). Ability to "Make a Fresh Start" (archive old budget data, start fresh with accounts/categories).

2.2. Budget Screen (Core Interface):

Requirement: Display budget data in a spreadsheet-like grid.

Requirement: Rows:

Category Groups: User-creatable, editable (rename), reorderable, deletable (only if empty), collapsible/expandable. Default groups might be suggested (e.g., "Immediate Obligations", "True Expenses").

Categories: User-creatable within groups, editable (rename), reorderable within/between groups, deletable (handling existing funds/transactions needs rules - e.g., reassign funds/transactions first).

Requirement: Columns:

Category Name: Displays category name. Clickable to potentially view category-specific details/transactions.

Assigned: Direct input field. User types amount. Updates TBB in real-time. Input validation (numeric).

Activity: Non-editable. Sum of all transactions (outflows negative, inflows positive) categorized to this category in the current month. Clicking could potentially filter the transaction view.

Available: Non-editable. Calculated as Available Last Month + Assigned This Month - Activity This Month. This is the core envelope balance. Rolls over month-to-month.

Requirement: "To Be Budgeted" (TBB) Display: Always visible at the top. Calculated as (Ready to Assign from Last Month + Inflows categorized as TBB This Month) - Total Assigned This Month. Must be $0 for a balanced budget. Color-coded (e.g., Green for >=0, Red for <0).

Requirement: Month Navigation: Clear buttons/dropdown (e.g., < Prev | Month Year | Next >) to move between months. Ability to jump multiple months. Budgeting in future months deducts from the current TBB or available category funds. Cannot budget future income.

Requirement: Quick Budgeting Options (per category or multi-select):

Budgeted Last Month: Assigns the same amount as the previous month.

Spent Last Month: Assigns the amount spent in the previous month.

Average Budgeted (configurable period, e.g., last 3/6/12 months).

Average Spent (configurable period).

Underfunded: Assigns the amount needed to meet the category's goal for the month.

Reduce Overfunding: Sets assigned amount so 'Available' matches goal target (if applicable).

Set Available to 0: Moves any available money back to TBB.

Requirement: Visual Cues:

Available Balance: Green background/text for positive, Grey/Neutral for zero, Red background/text for negative (overspent).

Goal Progress: Integrated progress bar within the row or next to the 'Available' amount. Color changes based on funding status relative to goal (e.g., orange/yellow if underfunded, green if funded, blue if on track for date-based goals). Tooltip shows goal details on hover.

Overspending Alert: Red 'Available' amount is primary. May also include an icon or badge. Requires user action.

Requirement: Moving Money Tool:

Accessible directly from the 'Available' column (e.g., clicking the amount).

Modal/popover allowing selection of 'From Category', 'To Category', and 'Amount'.

Real-time update of involved categories' 'Available' balances and no change to TBB.

Requirement: Notes: Ability to add notes per category per month (e.g., "Saving extra $50 here for birthday").

2.3. Accounts Screen:

Requirement: Display list of all accounts grouped by type (Budget, Tracking).

Requirement: Account Types:

Budget: Checking, Savings, Cash, Credit Card, Line of Credit. (Affect budget totals, transactions require categorization).

Tracking: Assets (Investment Account, Brokerage, Property Value, Vehicle Value), Liabilities (Mortgage, Student Loan, Auto Loan, Other Loan). (Balances contribute to Net Worth, transactions generally don't affect budget categories unless it's a transfer to/from a Budget account).

Requirement: Account Management:

Add Account: Wizard guiding through type selection, naming, linking (optional), starting balance entry.

Edit Account: Rename, change account type (with warnings/rules), manage connections, edit notes.

Close Account: Archive the account, hide from main views but retain history. Needs handling of remaining balance (transfer out).

Requirement: Linked Accounts (Bank Sync via Plaid/Finicity/etc.):

Secure OAuth flow for connecting accounts.

Display connection status (Connected, Error, Needs Update).

Automatic transaction import at regular intervals (or user-triggered sync).

Handling of duplicate transactions during import.

Mechanism for re-authentication when required by the bank.

User control over which linked accounts are Budget vs. Tracking.

Requirement: Manual Accounts: Full manual transaction entry required.

Requirement: Reconciliation Workflow:

Button per account to start reconciliation.

User enters the current actual cleared balance from their bank statement/website.

App displays cleared balance vs. entered balance difference.

User reviews uncleared transactions, marking them 'Cleared' (c) as they appear on the bank statement. Checkbox UI.

Running balance updates as transactions are cleared.

If balances don't match after clearing transactions, prompt user to create an adjustment transaction (inflow or outflow) to force balance match.

Upon successful reconciliation, lock all cleared transactions up to that date (prevents accidental editing). Display 'Last Reconciled' date.

Requirement: Balance Display: Clearly show both 'Cleared Balance' (sum of cleared transactions) and 'Working Balance' (sum of all transactions, including uncleared) for each account. Also show 'Uncleared Balance'.

2.4. Transaction Management:

Requirement: Transaction List View: Display transactions for selected account(s) or all accounts, sortable and filterable. Columns: Account, Date, Payee, Category, Memo, Outflow, Inflow, Cleared Status (Uncleared, Cleared 'c', Reconciled 'R'/lock icon).

Requirement: Manual Entry Form: Fields for Account, Date (default to today), Payee (autocomplete based on history), Category (dropdown/search, linked to Budget screen), Memo (optional), Outflow OR Inflow amount. Ability to mark as cleared immediately.

Requirement: Payee Management: System automatically saves payees. Allow merging duplicate payees, managing renaming rules (e.g., map "Shell Station #123" to "Gasoline"). Optional: Location awareness for payee suggestions (mobile).

Requirement: Imported Transactions:

Appear in a dedicated "Needs Approval" section or highlighted in the account register.

Require user to select a Category. System should suggest categories based on payee history or predefined rules (editable by user).

Auto-categorization rules engine (e.g., "If Payee contains 'Netflix', Category is 'Subscriptions'").

Mechanism to match imports with existing manual entries (if user enters manually before import). Suggest matches based on date/amount.

Flag for review state.

Requirement: Split Transactions: Ability to split a single transaction (manual or imported) across multiple categories with different amounts. UI should clearly show the total transaction amount and the allocation, ensuring the split sums to the total.

Requirement: Scheduled Transactions:

Set up recurring transactions: Amount, Payee, Category, Frequency (Daily, Weekly, Every Other Week, Monthly, Twice a Month, Every X Months, Yearly), Start Date, End Date (optional).

Option for system to auto-enter transaction on the due date or prompt user for approval.

Visual indicator for upcoming scheduled transactions (e.g., greyed out in register, dedicated upcoming view).

Requirement: Transfers:

Special transaction type between two Budget accounts.

Requires selecting 'Transfer From' and 'Transfer To' accounts.

No Category needed. Outflow from one account, Inflow to the other. Does not impact TBB.

Transfers involving a Tracking account DO impact the budget (e.g., Transfer from Checking [Budget] to Mortgage [Tracking] needs a 'Mortgage Payment' category; Transfer from Brokerage [Tracking] to Checking [Budget] counts as Inflow to TBB).

Requirement: Search & Filtering: Robust search bar querying Payee, Category, Memo fields. Advanced filtering options: Date range, Amount range, Category, Account, Cleared status, Transaction type (Inflow, Outflow, Transfer), Tags/Flags (optional bonus feature).

Requirement: Bulk Editing: Select multiple transactions to edit Category, Flag, or Delete.

2.5. Goal Setting:

Requirement: Set goals directly on a Category from the Budget screen.

Requirement: Goal Types:

Needed For Spending: Target Amount + Target Date (specific day or monthly). Optional: Repeat frequency (e.g., yearly for insurance). System calculates required monthly funding. Shows pace (on track, behind).

Target Savings Balance: Target Amount. Optional: Target Date. If no date, encourages consistent saving. If date, calculates monthly funding needed.

Monthly Savings Builder: Target Monthly Amount. Simple goal to contribute X amount each month.

Requirement: Visual Feedback on Budget Screen: Progress bars, color-coding (underfunded, funded), amount needed displayed clearly. Tooltips show full goal details.

Requirement: Quick Budget Integration: "Underfunded" quick budget option uses goal calculation.

Requirement: Goal Management: Edit goal parameters, delete goal.

2.6. Handling Credit Cards:

Requirement: Credit Card accounts function as Budget accounts.

Requirement: Budgeted Spending: When a transaction occurs on a Credit Card account and is assigned to a spending category (e.g., $50 Groceries), the system must:

Decrease the 'Available' amount in the 'Groceries' category by $50.

Automatically increase the 'Available' amount in the dedicated 'Credit Card Payment' category associated with that specific card by $50. This reserves the cash for payment.

Requirement: Credit Card Payment Category: Automatically created for each credit card account. Its 'Available' amount shows how much cash is set aside to pay the card. This category is generally not budgeted to directly, except to cover overspending or existing debt.

Requirement: Making a Payment: Record a Transfer from a cash account (e.g., Checking) to the Credit Card account. This reduces the 'Available' amount in the 'Credit Card Payment' category and reduces the card's liability balance. Does not affect TBB or spending categories.

Requirement: Credit Overspending: If a purchase is made on the card for more than is 'Available' in the spending category (e.g., $60 Groceries but only $50 Available):

The 'Groceries' category Available becomes -$10 (Red).

Only $50 moves to the 'Credit Card Payment' category.

The extra $10 spent creates new debt on the card. The user must either:

Cover the $10 overspending in 'Groceries' from another category (best practice). This will then move the $10 to the CC Payment category.

Or, budget $10 directly to the 'Credit Card Payment' category later to pay off this new debt.

Requirement: Returns/Refunds: A refund transaction on the credit card:

If it matches a previous purchase, inflow should ideally go back to the original spending category.

If the category is no longer needed/relevant, or it's a general statement credit, inflow can go to TBB. System might need rules or user choice here. This also reduces the amount needed in the CC Payment category.

Requirement: Starting Balance/Existing Debt: When adding a CC with an existing balance, the user needs to budget funds directly to the 'Credit Card Payment' category over time to pay down that pre-existing debt.

2.7. Handling Overspending:

Requirement: Immediate Feedback: Negative 'Available' balance in a category shown in Red on the Budget screen.

Requirement: Resolution Guidance: UI should prompt the user to cover the overspending. Clicking the red amount could trigger the "Move Money" tool, pre-filled to cover the exact amount needed in the target category.

Requirement: Covering Mechanism: User must select another category with a positive 'Available' balance and move funds from it to the overspent category until its 'Available' balance is >= $0. This must happen within the current budget month.

Requirement: Cash vs. Credit Impact Distinction:

Cash Overspending (Checking/Cash accounts): If not covered by moving money from another category by month-end, the TBB for the next month will be reduced by the overspent amount. The category balance resets to $0 for the new month.

Credit Overspending: If not covered by moving money from another category by month-end, it becomes new debt on the credit card. The category balance resets to $0 for the new month, but the Credit Card balance is higher, and the user will need to budget funds directly to the 'Credit Card Payment' category in the future to pay it off.

Requirement: Overspending Warning: A general indicator might be shown if any categories are overspent, reminding the user action is needed before the month ends.

2.8. Reporting:

Requirement: Spending Report: Pie chart and table view of spending by Category and Category Group for a selected time period. Filterable by account(s), category(ies), time range (this month, last month, year-to-date, custom). Drill-down capability (click category to see transactions). Spending by Payee report also useful.

Requirement: Income vs. Expense Report: Bar chart or line chart showing total income and total expenses per month over a selected time period. Table view with totals. Filterable by time range, account(s), category(ies).

Requirement: Net Worth Report: Line chart showing total Assets (Budget + Tracking Accounts) minus total Liabilities (Credit Cards + Tracking Accounts) over time. Table view showing asset/liability breakdown per month. Filterable by time range, account(s).

Requirement: Age of Money (AoM) Report/Metric:

Calculation: Based on the average age of the dollars used in the last 10 cash-based outflow transactions from Budget accounts (excluding credit cards). Age is calculated from the most recent inflow date of those dollars (based on TBB inflows). (This is complex; requires tracking income dates and FIFO/Average Cost basis for cash spending). Alternatively, a simpler proxy might be used initially, like (Total Cash in Budget Accounts) / (Average Daily Spend over X days), clearly documenting the method.

Display: Prominent display of the AoM number (in days). A small chart showing AoM trend over time. Explanatory text on what it means and why aiming for > 30 days is beneficial.

Requirement: Report Export: Ability to export report data to CSV.

2.9. User Experience (UX) & User Interface (UI):

Requirement: Clean, Minimalist Design: Focus on data clarity. Avoid visual clutter. Consistent typography and color palette.

Requirement: Intuitive Navigation: Easy access to Budget, Accounts, Transactions, Reports, Settings. Consistent navigation patterns across platforms.

Requirement: Responsive Design: Web app adapts to various screen sizes. iOS and Android apps follow platform-specific design guidelines (HIG, Material Design) while maintaining functional consistency.

Requirement: Clear Feedback: Instant visual confirmation for actions (assigning money, moving money, saving changes). Loading indicators for async operations (syncing, report generation). Clear error messages.

Requirement: Encouraging Tone: Language should be supportive and non-judgmental. Overspending is presented as a problem to solve, not a failure. Successes (e.g., reaching goals, increasing AoM) can be subtly celebrated.

Requirement: Onboarding:

Simple account creation.

Guided setup wizard: Link first account, explain TBB, guide through assigning initial funds to essential categories.

Brief tutorial or tooltips explaining the core four rules and key UI elements.

Requirement: Accessibility: Adherence to accessibility standards (WCAG) including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, sufficient color contrast.

2.10. Technical Considerations:

Requirement: Platform:

Web: Single Page Application (SPA) using React, Vue, or Angular.

iOS: Native Swift application.

Android: Native Kotlin application.

(Consider RN/Flutter only if significant development time savings are proven AND native-level performance/feel, especially list scrolling and animations, can be achieved and maintained).

Requirement: Backend API: RESTful or GraphQL API. Built with Node.js (Express/NestJS), Python (Django/Flask), Ruby (Rails), or similar robust framework. Handles all business logic, calculations, data storage, bank sync interactions.

Requirement: Database: PostgreSQL strongly recommended due to relational nature of financial data. Needs robust indexing for performance.

Requirement: Security:

HTTPS enforced for all communication.

Password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).

Encryption of sensitive data at rest (database encryption).

Secure handling of bank credentials via aggregator tokens (Plaid/Finicity) - credentials never stored on app servers.

Regular security audits. OAuth 2.0 for authentication tokens.

Requirement: Synchronization: Near real-time sync across user's devices. WebSockets or efficient polling for updates. Robust conflict resolution strategy for offline changes (e.g., last write wins, or more sophisticated CRDT approach if needed).

Requirement: Bank Aggregation: Integration with Plaid (preferred for US/Canada/EU coverage) or alternative like Finicity or regional providers. Must handle API key management securely, webhook notifications for updates, error handling, and user consent flows.

Requirement: Infrastructure: Cloud-based hosting (AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalability, reliability, and managed services (database, load balancing).

2.11. Monetization Model:

Requirement: Subscription-Based: Primarily annual subscription with a slightly higher monthly option.

Requirement: Free Trial: Fully functional 34-day free trial (aligns with typical monthly cycle + buffer). No credit card required upfront for trial activation. Clear communication before trial ends.

Requirement: Payment Integration: Use a reputable payment processor (Stripe, Braintree) for handling subscriptions securely.

6. UI Mockup Descriptions (Conceptual):

Budget Screen:

Layout: Header with prominent "To Be Budgeted" amount. Main area is a dense spreadsheet grid. Optional sidebar for budget summary/quick actions.

Header: TBB amount (large font, color-coded), Month Navigator, potentially AoM metric.

Grid: Collapsible Category Group rows. Category rows within groups. Columns: Category Name (clickable), Assigned (input field), Activity (plain text), Available (colored background/text, clickable for Move Money). Goal progress bars integrated into rows. +/- icons for collapsing groups. Add Category/Group buttons visible.

Interaction: Clicking 'Assigned' allows typing. Clicking 'Available' opens 'Move Money' popover. Multi-select checkboxes for categories enable Quick Budget buttons.

Accounts Screen:

Layout: Two main sections: "Budget Accounts" and "Tracking Accounts". List layout within each. Header might show total Net Worth.

Account Row: Account Name, Current Working Balance (large), Cleared Balance (smaller), Uncleared Balance (optional). Buttons for 'Add Transaction', 'Reconcile'. Indicator for Linked Account status.

Interaction: Clicking account row navigates to Transaction Register view for that account. Add Account button prominent.

Transaction Register:

Layout: Standard table/list view. Header shows Account Name and Balances. Search bar and filters above the list.

Transaction Row: Columns for Date, Payee, Category (dropdown/link), Memo, Outflow, Inflow, Cleared Status (Checkbox/Icon). Hover reveals edit/delete options. Imported transactions might have a distinct background or icon until approved/categorized.

Interaction: Clicking fields allows editing (if not reconciled). Checkbox toggles cleared status during reconciliation. 'Add Transaction' button always visible. Split transaction icon indicates multiple categories.

7. Technology Stack Suggestions:

Web Frontend: React or Vue.js (Component-based, good ecosystem, performance). State management: Redux Toolkit / Zustand (React), Pinia (Vue). UI Library: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, or a component library like Material UI / Chakra UI.

iOS Frontend: Swift with UIKit or SwiftUI (SwiftUI preferred for modern development if team is skilled). Standard iOS architecture patterns (MVVM, VIPER).

Android Frontend: Kotlin with Jetpack Compose (preferred modern UI toolkit) or XML Layouts + ViewModels. Standard Android architecture patterns (MVVM).

Backend: Node.js with TypeScript (Express or NestJS). Strong typing, good performance for I/O bound tasks (API calls, DB queries), large ecosystem (NPM). Alternatives: Python (Django/FastAPI), Ruby on Rails.

Database: PostgreSQL (Relational integrity, ACID compliance, JSONB support for flexibility if needed). Use an ORM like Prisma, TypeORM (Node), SQLAlchemy (Python), ActiveRecord (Rails).

Bank Aggregation: Plaid (Check pricing and API features).

Payments: Stripe (Excellent developer experience and docs).

Infrastructure: AWS (EC2/Fargate for compute, RDS for PostgreSQL, S3 for static assets, CloudFront CDN, SES for email) or Google Cloud (Cloud Run/GKE, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, Cloud CDN, SendGrid) or Azure equivalents.

Real-time Sync: WebSockets (Socket.IO library) or managed service like Pusher / Ably.

Caching: Redis (for caching frequent calculations like TBB, report data).

This detailed specification provides a comprehensive blueprint for developing the YNAB clone application, focusing on replicating the core philosophy and functionality effectively across platforms. Remember that iterative development and user feedback will be crucial throughout the process.
